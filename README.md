Hello everyone! 👋   
It's my education project based on Spring+Hibernate Udemy course.

##### Now my project could do:

1. Add users to the database
2. Update data of existing user
3. Remove user from db
4. List all users

##### Minor staff:
- Logging
- Using AOP via Spring AOP

---
##### List of technologies:

- Spring Web+MVC
- Hibernate ORM
- Thymeleaf
- Project Lombok
- Log4J Logging
- Spring AOP
- JavaEE

##### And all this staff works on:

- JDK 17
- Tomcat 9
- PostgreSQL
- Gradle

---
My next milestone is to dive into **Spring Security 👮‍♂️**

##### Later, I'll try to implement:

- Hibernate Validation
- Unit testing by JUnit
