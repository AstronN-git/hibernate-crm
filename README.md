Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹   
It's my education project based on Spring+Hibernate Udemy course.

##### Now my project could do:

1. Add users to the database
2. Update data of existing user
3. Remove user from db
4. List all users (of course)

---
##### List of technologies:

- Spring Web+MVC
- Hibernate ORM
- Thymeleaf
- Project Lombok
- JavaEE

##### And all this staff works on:

- JDK 17
- Tomcat 9 + JavaEE
- PostgreSQL

My next milestone is **Learn AOP**

##### Also, I'll try to implement:

- Hibernate Validation
- Log4J Logging
- Unit testing by JUnit

Track new commits. Goodbye for now! âœ‹
